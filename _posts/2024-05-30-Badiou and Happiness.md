> Affirmative experience of an interruption of finitude<!--more-->

2023 was a year marked by intensive reading. In the latter part of the year, as the golden autumn breeze of New England gave way to a chilling winter gale, I borrowed "Happiness" from MIT’s Hayden Library. This was my introduction to Alain Badiou, and, unsurprisingly, led me to Gilles Deleuze's "Nietzsche and Philosophy" shortly thereafter.

### Two Poles
It is only fair to apprehend the recent developments in Western philosophy through the opposing poles of Badiou and Deleuze. Their philosophies diverge significantly: Badiou focuses on concepts such as Rejection, Interruption, Subjectivation, and Twoness, while Deleuze espouses Affirmation, Continuity, Life, and Multiplicity.

### Immanence
In the context of "Happiness", it pertains to explore how Badiou and Deleuze each treat the concept of Immanence, drawing from Spinoza's work.

Deleuze, and his interpretation of Nietzsche, views Life as a force that continuously evolves from finitude to infinitude. In his philosophy, infinitude is immanent to finitude because Life suffices to differentiate itself into multiplicity. This perspective, while enlightening and bizzarely comforting, can too easily degenerate into two seemingly opposing trends of Accelerationism and Tangpingism, mainly due to the minimal if still present role of subjectivity in his framework: the subject is merely a placeholder, never fully actualized.

On this point I find Badiou both empowering and encouraging. For Badiou, Immanence is always the Immanence of Truth to itself, and Truth always manifests as a Truth-Subject. The event of Immanence, as Badiou sees it, is an affirmative interruption of finite life by the infinite Truth-Subject. It is here, in this interruption, that Happiness is precisely located — an affirmative experience of an interruption of finitude, a jouissance of the impossible, a finite jouissance of the infinite.

### The Book
"The Metaphysics of Real Happiness", a short 200-pager, adeptly raises critical questions that actually matters not just to philosophers but to you and me and anyone grappling with the mediocrity and constraints of capitalist existence. Badiou, I salute as the True Communist, the True Marxist, the True Maoist, the True Fighter, the True Human, offers a revolutionary view on achieving real happiness.
